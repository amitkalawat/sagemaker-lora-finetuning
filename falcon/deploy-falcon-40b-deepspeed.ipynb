    "In this example we walk through how to deploy and perform inference on the **Falcon 40B model** using the **Large Model Inference(LMI)** container provided by AWS using **DJL Serving** and **DeepSpeed**. The Falcon 40B model is a casual decoder model that was trained on AWS SageMaker, on 384 A100 40GB GPUs in P4d instances. Because this is a large language model (LLM) that does not fit on a single GPU, we will use an 'ml.g5.24xlarge\" instance which has **4** GPUs.\n"
